## Overview

Final project for the course Applied WEB application Security. The goal was to create 3 laboratories in which each one needs to carry out a different cyber attack. 

On the index page for each laboratory there is a brief description, followed by the link of the site to be attacked. Test yourself!

At the end of the index page there is a link to the solutions and also at the top of the page there is a link to a youtube video showing them.

In Theoretical explanation.pdf file there is a detailed theoretical explanation of the attacks present in the laboratories.

## Compile and usability

* I recommend uninstalling MySQL if present on the pc (I had problems)
* Install EasyPHP-Devserver (v. 17.0)
* Copy sources folder in ...\EasyPHP-Devserver-17\eds-www\
* Run Devserver
* Servers -> Start / Restart All Servers
* Go to http://127.0.0.1/
* Pressing on the source folder will automatically open the project index, from there you can navigate between the various laboratories
